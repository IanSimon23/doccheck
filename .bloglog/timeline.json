What you wrote 3 months ago about \"how we work\" often doesn't match what you're actually doing. Most tools focus on writing docs; nothing focuses on keeping them true.\n\n## The Solution\nTwo-phase approach:\n1. **claudemd init** - Scans project architecture and bootstraps initial CLAUDE.md from what it finds (file structure, package files, README, code patterns)\n2. **claudemd check** - Validates CLAUDE.md against current reality, reports drift, suggests updates\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### The Reframe\nStarted as \"tool for Claude Code projects\" but quickly realized this is bigger - it's about **living documentation that stays true** for:\n- Human developers onboarding\n- Any AI coding assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)\n- Your future self\n- CI/CD validation\n- Technical documentation that doesn't lie\n\n### The Bootstrap Approach\nInstead of asking questions to generate CLAUDE.md (web tool), we're building CLI-first that **examines the project** and creates documentation from actual architecture:\n- Scans file structure\n- Reads package.json/requirements.txt\n- Analyzes README.md\n- Detects testing patterns\n- Identifies code conventions\n\nThen you review, fill in the human bits (business rules, gotchas), and from that point forward it validates reality.\n\n### The Meta-Irony\nBuilding a tool that will be able to generate its own CLAUDE.md by scanning itself. Ultimate dogfooding.\n\n## What Makes a Good CLAUDE.md\n\n**Project-Specific Context**: Tech stack, architecture decisions, file structure\n**Development Practices**: TDD approach, git workflow, code style\n**Domain Knowledge**: Business rules, terminology, edge cases\n**AI-Specific Guidance**: \"Always check X when modifying Y\", anti-patterns\n**Quality Gates**: Definition of Done, security, performance, accessibility\n\n## Technical Decisions Ahead\n\n### Language Choice (TBD)\n- Node.js: Familiar, good JSON parsing\n- Python: Rich stdlib, file operations\n- Rust: Fast, single binary distribution\n\n### Architecture\nFollowing Ian's pattern: Keep it simple, single-purpose tool, avoid framework complexity until proven needed.\n\n### Development Approach\n- TDD from the start\n- Dogfood on itself immediately\n- Test across portfolio (BlogLog, Knowledge Builder, Jironaut, etc.)\n- Iterate based on real usage\n\n## The Validation Logic (Core Value)\n\n### Drift Detection Examples\n- \"CLAUDE.md says React 18, package.json shows React 19\"\n- \"Testing section mentions Jest, but tests use Vitest\"\n- \"Documented folder structure doesn't exist\"\n- \"3 new files have no tests despite TDD policy\"\n\n### Output Format\n```\nCLAUDE.md Reality Check (2025-01-18)\n✓ 12 practices validated\n⚠️ 3 discrepancies found\n\nDRIFT DETECTED:\n[specific mismatches]\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n[actionable updates]\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### Immediate Value\n- Context-switch faster between projects\n- Accurate documentation for AI assistants\n- CI/CD validation of stated practices\n\n### Portfolio Value\n- Demonstrates systematic thinking\n- Shows AI integration expertise\n- Solves real problem developers face\n- Both CLI and web patterns (future)\n\n### Broader Impact\nCould become standard way to document projects beyond just Claude Code - it's linting for your project narrative, type checking for your documentation.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Create claude-md folder\n2. Set up basic CLI structure with Claude Code\n3. Implement project scanner\n4. Build CLAUDE.md template generator\n5. Test on itself (bootstrap validation)\n6. Test on BlogLog (first real-world use)\n7. Iterate based on findings\n\n## Files Created\n- Initial CLAUDE.md for the claudemd project (created from conversation, will eventually be generated by the tool itself)\n\n## Connections to Other Projects\n- **BlogLog pattern**: Capturing what happened, but for documentation not development\n- **Portfolio strategy**: Another tool showcasing AI integration and systematic thinking\n- **Developer workflow**: Fits existing TDD and git practices\n- **Curiouscoach.tools**: Could standardize documentation across all platform components\n\n## Open Questions\n- Language choice for implementation\n- Configuration strategy (inline in CLAUDE.md vs separate config)\n- How opinionated should detection be?\n- When to prompt for human review vs auto-update?\n\n## Status\n**Just Starting** - Concept validated through conversation, ready to build CLI prototype with Claude Code.",
